# Rust 101 for C++ developers

In recent years, a new language called Rust appeared. Unlike many other
that claim to be systems languages, it delivers on that promise and allows
solving problems where previously C and C++ were the only options. Furthermore
C++ was one of the main influences of Rust. One could therefore say Rust is
C++'s younger sibling. And we should know our close family members no matter if
we like them or not.

Let's have a look what parts of the language are just plain copied, which are
very similar but also where the main differences lie. This is not an attempt to
teach Rust during the talk, as Rust is (similarly to C++) quite large and
complex language. We'll instead highlight some interesting aspects,
philosophical decisions and solutions instead and leave the boring part like
exact syntax constructs as a homework for the curious listener.
