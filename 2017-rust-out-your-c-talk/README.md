### Code

The code for my rewrite of Zopfli from C to Rust lives on github at [carols10cents/zopfli](https://github.com/carols10cents/zopfli). The state it was in for the Techfest and FP meetup talks is preserved [on the techfest branch](https://github.com/carols10cents/zopfli/tree/techfest); any work done after the talk will be on [the master branch](https://github.com/carols10cents/zopfli).
